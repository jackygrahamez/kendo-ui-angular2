# Kendo UI Drawing API

This repository contains the source code and documentation of the Kendo UI Drawing package.

It is a cross-browser vector graphics library. It offers a simple object model for building and manipulating visual scenes.

## Basic Usage

You build a scene by creating drawing elements such as curves, images, and text. Scene elements are live and respond to changes of their appearance and geometry.

A drawing surface is used to render scenes on and off screen. Surfaces encapsulate specific browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas.

To draw a visual scene, add a HTML element to the page that will serve as the surface container:

```html

    <div id="container" style="position: relative; width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

```

create the drawing shapes that build the scene:

```javascript

    import { Circle, Surface } from '@telerik/kendo-drawing/drawing';
    import { Circle as GeometryCircle } from '@telerik/kendo-drawing/geometry';
    
    const geometry = new GeometryCircle([100, 100], 100);
    const circle = new Circle(geometry);

```

create the surface and draw the shapes:

```javascript

    const surface = Surface.create(document.getElementById("container"));

    surface.draw(circle);

```

## Installation

The Drawing API is published as a [scoped NPM package](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) in the [NPMJS Telerik account](https://www.npmjs.com/~telerik).

Install it using NPM.

```bash
npm install --save '@telerik/kendo-drawing';
```

Once installed, import the drawing and geometry elements that you require.

```javascript
// ES2015 module syntax
import { Circle, Surface } from '@telerik/kendo-drawing/drawing';
//or
import { Point, Circle as GeometryCircle } from '@telerik/kendo-drawing/geometry';
```
```javascript
// CommonJS format
var drawing = require('@telerik/kendo-drawing').drawing;
//or
var geometry = require('@telerik/kendo-drawing').geometry;
```

> To install the npm package, it is recommended that you use Node.js 5.0.0 or later versions.
